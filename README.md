# ToDoApp
To do app using kotlin language using android studio tool


Description of Project
------------------------
It is a To-do app that I made using Kotlin.
In this app I take priority and name of the task from the user and then based on the priority I set the color for that task.
We can update the task and the priority level as per our requirements.Similarly I can update the app further by adding Category and status.
We can delete the task , once it has done.
In this I useRoom storage for the local storage purpose of tasks.
With Insufficient of time I have to do the following.
     Updations that want to make
      1.Adding the Drop down menu for the status purpose. The status options like "New, Completed, Old,Deleted tasks etc..",then output will be display based on user requirements.
      2.Adding the Drop down menu for the Category purpose. when user wants to filter the tasks like "Important,Personnel,Family,Friends,Business etc..." ,then he will get the updated results on the device.
